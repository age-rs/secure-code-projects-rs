| sanitizers | [built into the compiler](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html) | Provides sanitizers for checking uninitialized memory access, uses of freed memory, memory leaks and data races between threads. |
| Miri  | https://github.com/rust-lang/miri             | An experimental interpreter for Rust's mid-level intermediate representation (MIR). It can run binaries and test suites of cargo projects and detect certain classes of undefined behavior, including Rust-specific ones that sanitizers cannot detect. Moreover, it can do this for arbitrary CPU architectures independent of the host ("cross-interpretation"). |

Language-independent tools such as [Valgrind](https://www.valgrind.org/), [Dr. Memory](http://www.drmemory.org/), [libdiffuzz](https://github.com/Shnatsel/libdiffuzz) etc. also work.

It can check for license conflict, banned crates, vulnerabilities and source of crates. The rules are defined in the [`deny.toml`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/blob/main/deny.template.toml) file and can be configured for your needs. |
